### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I do software development for living, and I enjoy working on side projects. One of those projects is [FluentSql](https://github.com/ernestoherrera/FluentSql). I have not been able to work much on it, and I would like some help. The following is the road map for this tool:

1. Work on Group By clause. This needs some design work as there is no fluent pattern for this clause.
2. Add PostGreSql -- SQL generator class.
3. Add MySql -- SQL generator class.
4. Add Oracle -- SQL generator class.
5. Add a module to create SQL statements to update the database. This is accomplished by reading the C# or VB entities, and then comparing the entitiy fields with the table fields.

Please let me know if you are interested. If you need more help after reading the Wiki, I will be happy to give you a quick overview.
